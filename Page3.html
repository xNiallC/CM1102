        <h3 class="bold">Google</h3>
        <br>
        Google to this day is immensely relevant to a staggering amount of people. It has both major consumer and business interest. Google processes, on average, forty thousand search queries every second of every day. Scaled up, this is 1.2 <span style="font-weight: bold">trillion</span> searches per year. Not only is Google still relevant, but it has an enormous market
        share in the industry of searching the internet, at a staggering 78%.
        <br>
        As consumers, we make use of Google on a daily basis using it to search for not only websites that are relevant to what we need (e.g. news, shopping), but we use it for images, directions, videos and much more. For most of us, it is the backbone to our usage of the internet, our link between the information we want, and the information itself.
        <br><br>
        <h3 class="bold">Other Technologies</h3>
        <br>
        Brin's other dealings besides Googles are all very relevant as much of his work is aimed at innovation and sustainable future. As mentioned in previous pages, he is researching and creating things such as large scale wind power farms, self-driving vehicles and electric automation. These are all cutting-edge technologies and have the central goal of safety and security for us and generations to come.

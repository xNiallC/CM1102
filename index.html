			<span class="bold">Sergey Mikhaylovich Brin</span> is best, and most importantly known as one of the co-founders of Google along with Larry Page. He was born in Russia on
			August 21st, 1973. He is currently the President of the parent company of Google, Alphabet Inc. As of October 2016 he is the 12th richest person in the world with a net worth of
			39.2 billion US dollars.
			<br />
			<br />
			Brin immigrated with his family at the age of 6 from the Soviet Union to the United States, where he later attended the University of Maryland and studied Mathematics along with
			Computer Science. Following his graduation there he moved to Stanford University where he acquired his PhD in Computer Science. This is where he met Larry Page, becoming friends and
			getting the initial idea to apply Brin's data mining system to build a web search engine. Their program became so popular that they suspended their studies to start Google. By using their combined
			skills from studying at university, they designed a method of using backlink data gathered by a web crawler to create measures of importance based on the contents of a web page, and developed a
			ranking algorithm to create a search engine superior to the ones that proceeded it.
			<br />
			<br />
			They began in their dorm room, filling it with computers to make a pseudo-laboratory, then quickly expanding into other dorm rooms. Their lack of space caused serious problems for expansion.
			Due to their lack of real web design skills, they created a basic HTML search page for users to to make simple searches on. Within 2 years of its inception, Google was hitting 10,000 searches per day.
			As it stands to this day, Google is the dominant search engine in the US (and global) market, with a share of 65.6%. It has indexed billions of web pages.

		The table above displays a brief history of major technical achievements along that Brin accomplished thus far, along with some notable awards he won during this time. Naturally, there would not be enough
		room on this one page for a table that shows everything he has achieved in his lifetime.
		<br />
		<br />
		To most people, Google is by far his most impactful creation as it heavily influences the operation of our daily lives, more that we really notice - most of us make many searches each day without even thinking.
		Beyond this, Brin works on other personal and business projects. He is heavily involved in Google's philanthropic arm aiming to help solve the world's climate problems via alternate energy. For
		example, he introduced a self-driving car with an AI that drove itself using radar sensors and video cameras. He has invested in a major offshore wind power development to aid the East Coast of the
		USA along with plans for a dozen in total. He is also an investor in Tesla Motors. In terms of research, he and Page have a customised Boeing 767 that have scientific equipment installed in them to aid NASA's collection
		of experimental data.
